LZ-based compression algorithm for JavaScript

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The file layout has changed in version 2, this is now a joint `commonjs` / `esmodule` project so modern build tools should be happy with it, but if importing a file directly (such as in a direct javascript project) it is important to use the correct one.

> [!TIP]
> The "old style" minified AMD file is available as `dist/index.umd.js` via various CDNs or package managers.

## Install via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lz-string)

```shell
$ npm install -g lz-string
$ lz-string input.txt > output.txt
```

## Command line

If installed globally there is a command line tool available, and a test suite that can use it to show things are working properly. If other langauges build a command line tool that supports the same arguments then the test suite can be run against them too.

```console
$ lz-string -h
Usage: lz-string [options] [input-file]

Use lz-string to compress or decompress a file

Arguments:
  input-file                  file to process, if no file then read from stdin

Options:
  -V, --version               output the version number
  -d, --decompress            if unset then this will compress
  -f, --format <type>         formatter to use (choices: "base64", "encodeduri", "raw", "uint8array", "utf16", default: "raw")
  -v, --validate              validate before returning (default: true)
  -o, --output <output-file>  output file, otherwise write to stdout
  -q, --quiet                 don't print any error messages
  -h, --help                  display help for command
```

> [!WARNING]
> Currently I cannot get NodeJS to read binary files correctly, so `raw` and `uint8array` are both compress-only, see [#139](https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string/issues/139) - Ryc

## Other languages

This lib has numerous ports to other languages, for server side processing, mostly. Here they are:

> [!CAUTION]
> These are all developed separately, so if you are using two versions to transfer data (such as a client and server version) it is important to check that they are compatible and have identical behaviours on the data!

> [!NOTE]
> Version 1.3.8 of this package had a slight change in the encoding which might impact compatibility.
